# Notes: 
#       1) I am adding water because I am not sure if it is significant for pH speciation or future calculations where Surface plays a role
#		(In general activity of water must be 1, but I am not sure If we will work with not diluted solutions)
#       2) The way to calculate the activity of the species will be introduced in the input file, but there is an exception that is water 
#	    it is calculated by Raoult’s law (Garrels and Christ,1965, p. 65-66). Therefore, the name H2O will be specific for water
#	3) The charge can be obtain by reading the string '# Name' character by character and if a + or - appears count it as charge (+ or -) 
#          and the number behind as the value of charge (+2, +3, etc). It can be later implentated.

# Notes:
#  1) First the secondary species names, and later the charge (which might be removed by a function which translates the strings into values),
#     then the primary species that form the reaction with its stoichiometric coefficient. (Where products are positives and reactants are negative, the stoichiometric value of th
#	secondary species is always 1 <-- This can be modified, I guess I just do it for simplicity) 
#  2) The line -log_k states the log value of the defined reaction. (Like Phreeqc I suposse that log_K is at 25°C)
#  3) More lines can be written, behind to add parameters. (e.g. Parameter for temperature and the log_K) <-- must be discussed.
