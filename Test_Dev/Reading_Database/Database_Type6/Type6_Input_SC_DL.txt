Solution
# Concentrations which are supposed to be mol/L

H+	1e-8		# Actually pH = -log(ah+),  so if pH is given no H+ need, and also what would be given would be ah, not concentration of the basis, must be discussed
Na+	8.436e-5
Cl-	8.436e-5

Sorption
# Name of the primary surface ('Surface_component')	# mols or (mols/L) T_solid 	# Specific_surface_area [m^2/g]		# grams [g]/ solid concentration [g/l]
# Units must still be decided or be assured by the user that they have sense
