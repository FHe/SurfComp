Solution
# Concentrations which are supposed to be mol/L

H2O 	55.5555556		# Maybe define in other form or even not define, must be discussed
H+	8.749837752274364e-10		# Actually pH = -log(ah+),  so if pH is given no H+ need, and also what would be given would be ah, not concentration of the basis, must be discussed
Ca+2	1.227e-05
CO3-2	1.227e-05
